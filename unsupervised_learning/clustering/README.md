# Clustering

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that groups data points together based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns in the data and group similar data points together. Clustering is used in a variety of applications, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.

There are many different clustering algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular clustering algorithms include:
* K-means clustering
* Hierarchical clustering
* Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering
* Affinity Propagation
* Agglomerative clustering
...
