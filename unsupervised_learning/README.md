# Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision

## [Dimensionality Reduction](./dimensionality_reduction)

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.


## [Clustering](./clustering)

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that groups data points together based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns in the data and group similar data points together. Clustering is used in a variety of applications, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.

## [Hidden Markov Models](./hmm)

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a class of probabilistic graphical model that are used to model sequences of data. They are used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, bioinformatics, and finance.

## [Hyperparameter tuning](./hyperparameter_tuning)

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins, and they can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in the machine learning process, as it can help improve the performance of the model and reduce overfitting.
