# Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision

## [Dimensionality Reduction](./dimensionality_reduction)

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.


## [Clustering](./clustering)

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that groups data points together based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns in the data and group similar data points together. Clustering is used in a variety of applications, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.
