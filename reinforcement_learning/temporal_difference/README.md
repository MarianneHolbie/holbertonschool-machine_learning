# Temporal Difference Learning

Temporal difference learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming methods. It is a model-free method that learns directly from the raw experience without the need for a model of the environment. Temporal difference learning is a popular method for training agents in environments where the state space is too large to be represented explicitly.
