# Attention mechanism

Attention mechanism is a mechanism that allows a model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making predictions. It is a concept that was inspired by the human brain, which is able to focus on a specific part of an image or a sentence when processing information.

In the context of deep learning, attention mechanism is used in various tasks such as machine translation, image captioning, and speech recognition. It allows the model to learn to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, which can improve the performance of the model.

In this section, we will explore the attention mechanism in more detail, including how it works, its applications, and how to implement it in deep learning models.
